20 credits, 33% of year 4 mark. 416 hours worth of work (104 hours for a 5 cred module)

Finished around week 8 or 9 in semester 2

Weekly log -> every document you create in a week is submitted to a log. Interim report is created by week 10/11 and needs a working prototype. Worth a 5th of the marks.

Zotero -> tracks your websites for researching.

Copy all the URLs you look at. Give it a name and why you were looking at it. 

Grading is done by a second reader initially. Supervisor will discuss and initial grade. For final grade there is a supervisor, second reader and monitor.

You have to actively engage the supervisor, it's not their responsibility to chase after you.

Supervisors are not necessarily experts in your project area. Help you with the process, not necessarily the technology. They advise.

Documentation and presentation VERY IMPORTANT.

"Inspired by" other ideas, not copied.

Contact Seán and Ciarán if you cannot get engagement from your supervisor.

When asking lecturers questions, read the notes first and reference this.
