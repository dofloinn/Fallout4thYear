### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Referencing Tools</mark>

If you use someone else's work, you must acknowledge your original source or sources.  

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">By referencing you:</mark>
- impress with the range of book, sources etc you consulted  
- demonstrate an ability to build an argument  
- show that you understand and are on top of a subject  
- give links so that others can go have a look later at your sources  
- avoid any suspicion of plagiarism.  

We can use electronic applications to manage this in our projects

### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Universal Design</mark>

Universal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size or disability - Irish Disability Act, 2005

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Universal Design means:</mark>
- Design Once 
- Include All  

It is not (just) about disability - It is about <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">usability for all</mark>

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Universal Design says:</mark>
- Stop designing as if everyone is the same
- Acknowledge that diversity is the norm..

Universal design is an approach to design that honours human diversity. It addresses the right for everyone – from childhood into their oldest years – to use all spaces, products and information, in an independent, inclusive and equal way.  - Elaine Ostroff

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Principles of Universal Design:</mark>
1. Equitable Use  
2. Flexibility in Use  
3. Simple and Intuitive  
4. Perceptible Information  
5. Tolerance for Error  
6. Low Physical Effort  
7. Size and Space for Approach and Use

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Reasons for UD:</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Ethical Reasons:</mark> Organisations should adhere to ethical obligations, both for PR purposes and for opportunities to interact with the community.
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Legal Reasons:</mark> There is a great deal of legislation around accessibility, and IT companies need people who are familiar with these obligations.
