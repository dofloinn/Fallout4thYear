### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Project Start</mark>

Your FYP project starts right now  

You settle on an idea and research it  

You write up your idea as a formal proposal  

This is submitted via Brightspace (use template!)  

You get allocated a supervisor  

....and it’s game on....

### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Project Proposal</mark>

The project proposal contains all the details of your project idea and the approach to be followed and technology to be used.  

You should consult with lecturers in the School of Computer Science to discuss your idea and to get suggestions and feedback  
- Project Title  
- Summary  
- Background  
- Proposed Approach  
- Deliverables  
- Technical Requirements

### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Project Resources</mark>

Think of them as a contract between you and your examiner  

Rubrics tell you exactly what you need to do to achieve the mark you want  
Rubrics for interim and final submissions available in Brightspace  

It is extremely important to be familiar with the rubric!!

### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Weekly Logs</mark>

As part of the project process you should keep a weekly log of work carried out and meetings  

This will keep a track of what was delivered for a given week and what needs to be completed for the next week.  

This is a really good way to manage your project and document your achievements on a weekly basis.  

There will be a submission link each week on Brightspace, this will have a cut-off date/time. Submissions will be accepted only through Brightspace (i.e. Don’t email me)  

<mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">You should spend no more than 12 mins completing the log.</mark> This is a high level documentation of what was completed, what was discussed and what we need to do.

### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Traps to Avoid</mark>

Looking at ideas that are too simple (e.g. basic phone app) OR too hard (you only have till March/April)  

Looking at ideas that lack originality or that do not address a problem  

Picking an idea that sounds good but which you really have no interest in

### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Approach and Mindset</mark>

The project is a considerable amount of work.  

The best approach is to put a plan in place and work on your project week by week with your supervisor.  

The supervisor does not specify the work you need to do, they are there to guide you through the process and offer advice and feedback.

### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Equipment</mark>

There is a budget for specialised equipment  

We do have some equipment in stock too  

Equipment request needs to be filled out, signed by a lecturer too and submitted to school office  

Please download and fill out equipment request form (available in Brightspace) and email to Ciarán.

If you need specialised equipment / software to complete your project, please ensure you can get access to it in a timely manner. This can add undue delays to your project progress.

### <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Summary</mark>
