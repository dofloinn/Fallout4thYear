### <mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">What’s the Big Deal?</mark>
- Each case is a project  
- Any misstep will be pounced upon by the opposition  
- Managing the case as a project helps avoid errors in procedure  
- Good reporting allows you to demonstrate good process

### <mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Managing a Case</mark>

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Case flow can be divided into three stages:</mark>
- Preparation  
- Investigation  
- Presentation  

These three stages map well to the Investigative Model

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Preparation:</mark>
- Done outside the scope of a conventional investigation  
- Involves “creating” the case investigation team/department  
- Policies and procedures are defined  
- Team roles are defined

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Investigation:</mark>
- Triage  
- First response  
- Scene management  
- Lab preparation  
- Evidence handling  
- Evidence examination

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Triage:</mark>
- Assess any risks (to people, systems, or data)  
- Mitigate as many risks as possible  
- Determine priorities  
- Is saving the data more important than nabbing the culprit?  
- Is identifying the culprit worth a financial loss?

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">First Response:</mark>
- Use the crime scene first-response protocols whenever possible
- Determine the best method for collecting evidence  
- Perform live-response if necessary  
- Collect evidentiary materials in a forensically sound manner

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Crime Scene Management:</mark>
- Preserve the scene for other investigators  
- Survey the scene  
- Document the scene (with photos and videos)  
- Search the scene  
- Try to virtually reconstruct the crime

### <mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Lab Preparation:</mark> 

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Steps:</mark>
- Prepare a repository for digital evidence 
- Sufficient storage  
- Sufficient security  
- Ensure proper tools are ready  
- Ensure personnel are ready to receive evidentiary materials

### <mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Evidence Handling</mark>
- Prevent environmental contamination  
- Block electromagnetic transmissions  
- Maintain excellent chain of custody logs  
- Have a way to keep devices powered during transport  
- Don’t damage anything!
- Use the right tool for the job  
- Document everything you do  
- Never touch the originals

### <mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Presentation Stage</mark>  
- Avoid interpretation of results  
- Present all evidence, both incriminating and exculpatory  
- Be prepared to back up any statements or findings in the reports

### <mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Report Writing</mark>

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Contents of the final report:</mark>
- Case summary  
- Authorizations, warrants, and subpoenas  
- Procedural documentation  
- All case notes  
- All photographs and videos  
- A conclusion

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Case Summary</mark>
- Who requested the investigation?  
- Who are the principles involved?  
- When did the incident occur?  
- When was the report filed?  
- What allegedly happened?

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Procedural Documentation:</mark>
- An inventory of items examined  
- A list of tools used  
- A time line of procedures performed  
- A list of people who performed these procedures  
- Before/after hash values of each evidence image

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Findings:</mark>
- Details of how findings were obtained (tools used, search strings, etc.)  
- Results of each action described in the procedural documentation  
- A time line that puts the activities in perspective

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Report Conclusion:</mark>
- Ties all of the other parts of the report together  
- Presents evidence either supporting or refuting the initial claim  
- Does NOT support or refute the claim

### <mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">How to Write a Digital Forensics Report</mark>

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">What is a digital forensics report?</mark>
- A digital forensics report is a formal document that presents the findings of a digital investigation, often related to cybercrime, internal audits, or data breaches.  
- The report must be clear, structured, and contain all relevant details necessary for non-technical readers such as legal professionals or management, as well as technical experts.

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Structure of a report:</mark> 
- There really isn’t a de-facto standard or format for forensics report writing.  
- Formatting and layout options are up to the examiner/analyst or they may be required to follow a template for organisational policies or jurisdictional court rules.  
- The following slide goes through a sample structure.

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Structure of a report (sample):</mark>
- Title Page  
- Table of Contents  
- Overview / Case  
- Evidence  
- Objectives  
- Forensic Analysis (Steps Taken)  
- Relevant Findings  
- Conclusion

### <mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Structure of a report:</mark>

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Title Page:</mark> Basic details of the case name, name of report writer / investigators, contact info  

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Table of Contents:</mark> Apply a structure to the report and offer a ToC at the top of the report. 

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Overview:</mark> 
- Overview and a summary of the case. 
- What has been asked for with respect to the investigation (what are we doing?)

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Evidence:</mark>
- Present the details of the evidence in our chain of custody  
- Description of the hardware, make, model, serial numbers, description, condition, hash values etc...  

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Objectives:</mark> Describe in detail what you were specifically being asked to do for this investigation  

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Forensic Analysis (Steps Taken):</mark>
- This is what you did as part of your forensics investigation  
- What tools you used (make, model, and version of software etc...).  
- The steps taken, thoroughly documenting what you have done  
- This section is very important, try describe everything in granular detail

### <mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Structure of a report</mark>

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Relevant Findings:</mark>
- This will be a very detailed section of the report  
- Include all artifacts and relevant findings that you found as part of your investigation  

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Analysis and Interpretation:</mark>  
- <mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Data Recovery:</mark> Mention any data recovered (e.g., deleted files, artifacts, chat logs).  
- <mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">User Actions:</mark> Identify any actions taken by users (e.g., file access, external drive connections).  
- <mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Indicators of Compromise (IoCs):</mark> List any signs of compromise, such as malware, unauthorised logins, or suspicious activity.  

Each piece of evidence must offer a description that a layperson would understand

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Timeline:</mark> Create a timeline based on the forensic analysis (e.g., access times, login attempts, file modifications etc..).  

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Conclusion:</mark>
- Summary of the investigation, process followed and the findings  
- Any recommendations for further investigation

### <mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">What’s Soft and What’s Hard?</mark>

### <mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Data Abstraction Layers</mark> 

Moving information from thought to electronic impulse and back goes through a number of doors  

On an electronic level, data is not humanly readable  

On the human level, the CPU can’t function  

Abstraction layers move up and down the spectrum

### <mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Measuring Suitability of Tools</mark>

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">Four necessary traits:</mark>
- Accuracy  
- Verification capabilities  
- Consistency  
- Usability  

If even one trait is lacking the tool is unsuitable

### <mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">The Daubert Test</mark>

<mark style="background: #00ECFFA6;">From the court case Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals:</mark>
- Can the evidence presented be or has it been tested empirically and can it be falsified?  
- Has the approach or technique been the subject of peer review and publication?  
- Is the technique generally accepted within the scientific or professional community?  
- Does the technique or procedure contain a high known or potential rate of error?
