Case Information:  
An employee (Diana Prince) has been suspected of sharing confidential information with external parties to gain a potential financial advantage on investments.  

It is suspected that there may be additional employees involved as Sarah does not have direct access to sensitive company accounts / information.  

A pen drive was found in Diana’s (locked) desk drawer. An external company was tasked with securing the drive and creating a disk image using a forensic write blocker.  

As an employee of the IT team with forensics training you have been requested to analyse the image to link any data found to the company. It is a high priority to capture any company employee details linked to the data found on the drive. The chain of custody document has been provided on Brightspace. The image has been provided for us. As part of the report describe how this would be performed using a write blocker (check online for an example of how to do this).
