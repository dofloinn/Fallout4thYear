### <mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">Problem?</mark>

Data (and the ability to use manage and use it) is the main focus of modern computer systems

Volumes of data are growing rapidly

And so is the variation in the type of questions analysis organisations want to conduct using this data, which increasingly requires multiple types of data suited to data models other than relational

### <mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">Problem?</mark>

Organisations have lots and lots and lots of data that is not necessarily nicely structured and organised

They are constantly collecting more data

### <mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">Module Content:</mark>

<mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">Relational database design:</mark> reviewing and distinguishing between conceptual and logical design and addressing considerations and implications of implementing physical design from logical design.

<mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">Data warehouses:</mark> definitions, rationale, architectures, design, implementation, and manipulation; dimensional modelling techniques: design of star and snowflakes schemas, types of fact tables, conversion of relational model into dimensional model.

<mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">Distributed databases:</mark> definitions, rationale, architectures, design, implementation, and manipulation; approaches to fragmentation and replication (synchronous and asynchronous); the CAP theorem.

<mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">Document-oriented data stores:</mark> definitions, rationale, architectures, design, implementation, and manipulation; differentiating between document- oriented, key-value pairs, column-oriented and graph types; designing schema-less data structures;.

<mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">Data and database integration:</mark> process, challenges, benefits; ETL process for different database types; standards for interoperability and integration including JSON and Web services.

<mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">Optimisation and performance tuning:</mark> understanding the reasons for and the implications of poorly performing queries; identifying poorly performing queries and structures; examining how queries are executed in various database technologies; using constraints and indexes; choosing between alternative execution plans; amending queries to perform more appropriately.

<mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">Security and integrity:</mark> requirements, e.g. confidentiality, integrity, reliability, storage, and availability; security preserving approaches, integrity preserving approaches; polyglot persistence; transactions, concurrency control; the BASE model vs. the ACID model for transactions management.;

Emerging database technologies and application areas.

### <mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">Planned Technologies:</mark>

![[images/Pasted image 20250924112925.png]]

<mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">PostgreSQL:</mark> Relational Database

<mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">CouchDB:</mark> Open-source document-oriented NoSQL database, implemented in Erlang.

<mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">Cassandra:</mark> Open source, distributed and decentralised/distributed storage system (database)

<mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">Redis:</mark> Open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker

<mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">Docker:</mark> You can use Docker on your own local machine to create containers for each database type.

<mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">GitHub codespaces:</mark> You can use GitHub codespaces which will provide you with a cloud-based development environment where you can create containers for each database type.

### <mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">What will we do in the labs?</mark>

<mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">Setup:</mark>
- a relational database (PostgreSQL)
- a document store (CouchDB)
- a column-oriented store (Cassandra)
- an in memory store (Redis)

<mark style="background: #04FF00A6;">Implementing:</mark>
- optimization
- replication
- partitioning

Porting data between different data models
